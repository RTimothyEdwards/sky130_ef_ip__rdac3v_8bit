Analog IP design example: 8-bit Resistive ladder DAC in sky130

This is a simple 8-bit DAC demonstrating the use of the CACE system.

Requires the CACE system to run testbenches:

	https://github.com/efabless/cace

Schematics for this DAC are done in xschem and can be found in the xschem/
directory.  Layouts for this amplifier are done in magic and can be found
in the mag/ directory.

The CACE specification is in cace/sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit.txt.  Testbench
schematics are in the cace/ directory.  Note that testbenches are editable in
xschem, and netlists can be generated, but netlists contain variables that
must be substituted by CACE and cannot simulate prior to variable substitution
by CACE.

To run cace in GUI mode:

	/path/to/cace_gui.py cace/sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit.txt

CACE can also be run from the command line as:

	/path/to/cace.py cace/sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit.txt \
		cace/sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit_out.txt \
		-source=schematic \
		-param=<parameter_name> -summary"
